# Basic AWS Network Firewall Configuration Example

This example provides a reference implementation for a basic AWS Network Firewall deployment with Transit Gateway integration.

## Configuration Features

- Standard VPC configuration with public and private subnet architecture
- Network Firewall policy implementation with domain-based filtering capabilities
- Centralized logging configuration for audit and compliance requirements
- Resource tagging strategy for operational management

## Implementation Instructions

Execute the following commands to deploy this configuration:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Operational Considerations

- This configuration will provision billable AWS resources in your account. Review the AWS pricing documentation to understand associated costs before deployment.
- The implementation utilizes default parameter values to demonstrate a minimal viable configuration suitable for development and testing environments.
- Modify the CIDR address ranges and availability zone selections to align with your network architecture requirements.
